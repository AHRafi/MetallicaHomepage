				<h1>METALLICA</h1>
				<p>Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist
					James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.[1][2] The
					band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive
					 musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax
					 and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich,
					 longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form
					 Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus accident in
					 Sweden in 1986) and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.</p>
				<p>Metallica earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and won critical acclaim with its first five
					 albums.[3] The band's third album, Master of Puppets (1986),
					was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Its eponymous fifth album,
					Metallica (1991), the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal, appealed to a more mainstream audience,
					 achieving substantial commercial success and selling over
					16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After
					experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, the band returned to its thrash metal
					roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's
					earlier albums. Their most recent album is Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, released in 2016.</p>
				<p>In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several
					 other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent; after
					  reaching a settlement,
					Napster became a pay-to-use service in 2003. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film
					Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger
					(2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll
					 Hall of Fame. The band wrote the screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film Metallica: Through the Never,
					  in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.</p>
